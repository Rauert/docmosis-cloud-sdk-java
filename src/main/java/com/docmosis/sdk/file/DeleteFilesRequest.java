/**
 * The object holds the instructions and data for a request to the Delete File service.
 * See the Web Services Developer guide at <a href="https://www.docmosis.com/support">https://www.docmosis.com/support</a>
 * for details about the settings for the request.  The properties set in this class 
 * are parameters for the List request.
 * 
 * Typically, you would use the FileStorage class to get an instance of this class, 
 * then set the specifics you require using method chaining:
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   DeleteFileResponse deletedFile = FileStorage
 *                                      .delete()
 *                                      .path(fileName)
 *                                      .execute();
 *   if (deletedFile.hasSucceeded()) {
 *       deletedFile.toString();
